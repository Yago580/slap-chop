# Slap Chop

## Remove comments from your code!
Visit [slap-chop](https://slap-chop.herokuapp.com) and upload a ruby or js file. Select the **uncomment** option and Slap Chop will *chop* (see what I did there) all of the file's comments and send you back a brand spanking new comment free file.

## Remove logs from your code!
But there's more. If you select the **unlog** option, Slap Chop will remove all log statements from the uploaded file. Ruby (p, puts, print), JS (console.log).
